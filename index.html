      <p><h4><span>My</span> name is Garhett Morgan and the following is going to be a short synopsis of my life and where I've been.</h3></p>
      <p>First off, I was born on <i>February 23rd, 1986</i> in Seattle Washigton. I've been told that I'm somewhat of a unicorn here still living in the city as most people who live here seem to be transplants here due to the explosion of tech jobs across the northwest. In high school, I was a good student and gifted athlete. I grew up playing baseball and grew my talent to be among the best in the state in my age group. In fact, <span id="baseball">Baseball America</span> (a national baseball publication) ranked me in the list of top 25 sophmore baseball players when I was 16. I was an outstanding left handed pitcher on the national level. However, I spraigned my ulnar collatteral ligament my junior year which through my baseball career into a frenzy. That would prove to be the worst thing to happen to me still to this day. Luckily, I still had enough talent after recovering from my injury to play at the collegiate level. I packed my bags and moved to Chicago to attend Triton College, and a couple years later transfer to St. Xavier College. Unfortunately, I did not finish due to financial issues and I moved back home to Seattle.</p>

      <p>After a couple years of soul searching and under a mountain of student loan debt in the middle of the worst recession this country has seen in a hundred years, I decided to enlist in the <i>U.S. Army</i> in order to pay off my student loans. The army at the time had a great benefit to pay off 100% of my loans over 3 years. My job I chose to do was that of Combat Medic. Below is a list of stations the Army placed me over the course of 4 years and 4 months.</p>

      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>2009 Ft. Jackson, SC.  Basic Training</li>
        <li>2010 Ft. Sam Houston, TX. AIT or Medic Training</li>
        <li>2010 Ft. Hood, TX. Duty Station
          <ul>
            <li>2010-2011 COS Marez Mosul, Iraq</li>
            <li>2012-2013 BAF Bagrahm, Afghanistan</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>I outprocessed from the military in November of 2013 and moved back home to Seattle once again. Again, after some soul searching and working at a gym in Downtown Seattle, I decided to attend school again to finish my Bachelors degree that I started before. Because I went to school in Chicago, only about a third of my credits transferred to schools out in Seattle. Therefore I struggled to stay motivated. After hearing a radio commercial saying that Codefellows is accepted by the VA post 9/11 GI bill, I immediately dropped out of school to pursue their program and I haven't looked back! For now, my 4lb dog and I live right next to the waters of Lake Union on the North Shore where I get to look out at the city and reflect on this amazing journey I've been on.</p>
